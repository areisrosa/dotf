# supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
# X11). Note that it only sets the default background color's
# opacity. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
# powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
# use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
# not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
# default background color in your kitty config and not use a
# background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
# codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
# launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
# (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
# change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
# yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost)
