## :bookmark_tabs: Introduction
 I was struggling to find a Zsh theme and that had what I was looking for so 
 I made my own theme using Powerlevel10k!

This started as Anderson Reis's Computer shell configuration dotfiles but has
grown to a multi-developer platform for machine configuration.

## :computer: Installation :tea:
To get started please run:
```shell
 $ sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areisrosa/dotf/master/install.sh`"
```

> :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **NOTE**: Dotf will automatically install
> all of its subcomponents. If you want to be asked about each one, use:

```shell
$ sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areisrosa/dotf/master/install.sh`" -s ask
```
* When it finishes, open a terminal of your preference and go to the
    `~/.dotf/config/ketty` open the file ketty.conf choose a theme for
    kitty however comment the line font_family if you prefer another theme. If
    it isn't there for some reason, import it from `~/.dotf/fonts` -- you
    may also need to select the `Fira Code Nerd Font` font and check the box for
    non-ascii font;
* I've also found that you need to reboot before fast key repeat will be
    enabled.

> :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **NOTE**: I'll regularly add new
> configurations so keep an eye on this repo as it grows and optimizes.

## :arrow_down: Upgrade Instructions!

Brings huge changes. If you have made any modifications (and didn't make your
own fork), you will want to backup your dotfiles prior to running `git pull
--rebase` on `~/.dotf`.

Do the following to upgrade your ~/.dotf safely:

1. `cd ~/.dotf`
2. update dotfiles: `git pull --rebase`
3. run `./install.sh`  again

## :back: Restoring (dotf)iles

If you have existing dotfiles for configuring git, zsh, vim, etc, these will be
backed-up into `~/.dotf_backup/$(date +"%Y.%m.%d.%H.%M.%S")` and replaced with
the files from this project.

> :warning: **WARNING**: The restore script does not currently restore system
> settings--only your original dotfiles. To restore system settings, you'll
> need to manually undo what you don't like (so don't forget to fork, review,
> tweak)

## :metal: My personal customizations

<details><summary><code>Read on to learn what dofiles provides!</code>ðŸ‘ˆ Click</summary>
<p>

## :man_technologist: ZSH

Think of Zsh as a more awesome bash without having to learn anything new.
Automatic spell correction for your commands, syntax highlighting, and more.
We've also provided lots of enhancements:

* Vim mode, Fzf and bash style `Ctrl-R` for reverse history finder;
* `Ctrl-x,Ctrl-l` to insert output of last command;
* Fuzzy matching - if you mistype a directory name, tab completion will fix it.

## :see_no_evil: Aliases

Lots of things we do every day are done with two or three character
mnemonic aliases, please feel free to edit them:

* `ae` - alias edit
* `ar` - alias reload

## :octocat: Git - customizations

Dotfiles will take over your `~/.gitconfig`, so if you want to store your
usernames, please put them into `~/.gitconfig.user`

It is recommended to use this file to set your user info. Alternately, you can
set the appropriate environment variables in your `~/.secrets`.

* `git log` or `gl`              - a much more usable git log
* `git branch` or `gb`           - a list of branches with summary of last commit
* `git remote`                   - a list of remotes with info
* `git tag` or `gt`              - a list of tags with info
* `git checkout -b` or `gnb`     - a (n)ew (b)ranch - like checkout -b
* `gcp`                          - cherry-pick -x (showing what was cherrypicked)
* `git simple`                   - a clean format for creating changelogs
* `git recent-branches`          - if you forgot what you've been working on
* `git unstage` or `guns`        - (remove from index) and `git uncommit` /
* `gunc` (revert to the time prior to the last commit - dangerous if already pushed) aliases

> :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **NOTE**: Some sensible default configs, such
> as improving merge messages, push only pushes the current branch, removing
> status hints, and using mnemonic prefixes in diff: (i)ndex, (w)ork tree,
> (c\)ommit and (o)bject Slightly improved colors for diff `gdmb` (g)it (d)elete
> (m)erged (b)ranches - Deletes all branches already merged on current branch

### Github Issues: [ghi gem](https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi)

We include the `ghi` command. Try `ghi list` and have fun managing issues from
command line!


## :spider_web: Tmux - What's included? 

 * [Navigation](doc/tmux/navegation.md)
 * [Code manipulation](doc/tmux/coding.md)
 * [General enhancements that don't add new commands](doc/tmux/enhancements.md)

### Configuration

The `tmux.conf` provides some sane defaults for tmux on Mac OS like a powerful
status bar and vim keybindings. You can customize the configuration in
`~/.tmux.conf.user`.

### Prefix key

The default prefix is `C-b`. But I prefer use my muscle memory with prefix `C-a`
(`=C-a` or `^A`), if you want change the prefix then go to `~/.tmux.conf`.
```
# remap prefix to Control + w
set -g prefix C-w
bind C-w send-prefix
unbind C-b
```
:notebook_with_decorative_cover: **NOTE**: I'm going to assume that `C-w` is
your prefix.

### Tmux Cheatsheet

#### Sessions, windows, panes

* `Session` is a set of windows, plus a notion of which window is current.

* `Window` is a single screen covered with panes. (Once might compare it to a
  â€˜virtual desktopâ€™ or a â€˜spaceâ€™.)

* `Pane` is a rectangular part of a window that runs a specific command, e.g. a shell.

#### Getting help

* `C-a ?` - display a list of keyboard shortcuts:

#### Navigate using Vim or Emacs shortcuts

Depending on the value of `mode-keys`. Emacs is the default, and if you want
Vim shortcuts for help and copy modes (e.g. `j`, `k`, `C-u`, `C-d`), add the
following line to `~/.tmux.conf`:

```
setw -g mode-keys vi
```

> :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **NOTE**: Any command mentioned in this list
> can be executed as `tmux something` or `C-a :something` (or added to
> `~/.tmux.conf`).

#### Managing sessions

Creating a session:
```shell
$ tmux new-session -s work
```

Create a new session that shares all windows with an existing session, but has
its own separate notion of which window is current:

```shell
$ tmux new-session -s work2 -t work
```

Attach to a session:
```shell
$ tmux attach -t work
```

Switch between sessions:

* `C-a (`         - previous session
* `C-a )`         - next session
* `C-a L`         - â€˜lastâ€™ (previously used) session
* `C-a s`         - choose a session from a list

#### Managing windows

Switch between windows:

* `C-a 1` - switch to window `1, ..., 9, 0`
* `C-a p` - previous window
* `C-a n` - next window
* `C-a l` - â€˜lastâ€™ (previously used) window
* `C-a w` - choose window from a list

Switch between windows with a twist:

* `C-a M-n` - next window with a bell, activity or content alert
* `C-a M-p` - previous such window

#### Managing split panes

Creating a new pane by splitting an existing one:

* `C-a v` - split vertically (top/bottom)
* `C-a s` - split horizontally (left/right)

Moving panes around:

* `C-a {`         - move the current pane to the previous position
* `C-a }`         - move the current pane to the next position
* `C-a C-o`       - rotate window â€˜upâ€™ (i.e. move all panes)
* `C-a M-o`       - rotate window â€˜downâ€™
* `C-a !`         - move the current pane into a new separate window (â€˜break paneâ€™)
* `C-a`           - :move-pane -t :3.2 split window 3's pane 2 and move the current pane there

Resizing panes:

* `C-a M-up`, `C-a M-down`, `C-a M-left`, `C-a M-right` - resize by 5 rows/columns
* `C-a C-up`, `C-a C-down`, `C-a C-left`, `C-a C-right` - resize by 1 row/column

Applying predefined layouts:

* `C-a M-1`       - switch to even-horizontal layout
* `C-a M-2`       - switch to even-vertical layout
* `C-a M-3`       - switch to main-horizontal layout
* `C-a M-4`       - switch to main-vertical layout
* `C-a M-5`       - switch to tiled layout
* `C-a space`     - switch to the next layout

Switching between panes:

* `C-l`            - go to the next pane on the left
* `C-h`            - go to the next pane on the right
* `C-j`            - go to the next pane on the up
* `C-k`            - go to the next pane on the down
* `C-\`            - go to previous split
* `C-h/j/k/l/\`    - navigate between panes and including Vim splits
* `C-a o`          - go to the next pane (cycle through all of them)
* `C-a ;`          - go to the â€˜lastâ€™ (previously used) pane

Other:

* `C-a d`   - detach from a session:
* `C-a c`   - create a new window
* `C-a a`   - rename the current window;
* `C-a q`   - display pane numbers for a short while
* `C-a y`   - toggle "synchronize" to all panes of the current windows;
* `C-a z`   - toggle pane zoom between full window size and normal pane size.
* `C-a x`   - kill the current pane
* `C-a ,`   - rename the current window or
* `C-a &`   - kill the current window.

Copy and paste inside Tmux:

```
1) Alt-ESCAPE (=M-ESCAPE): enter copy mode, use vi keys for navigation
(h,j,k,l,H,M,L,g,G,/,?);
2) v: start selection;
3) y or Enter: The End Selection;
4) Alt-p (=M-p): paste selection.
```
> :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **NOTE**: Prefix- =: View all copy buffers
> and pastes selection (Press to ESCAPE (=Esc) mode or Enter select). Hold
> "Shift" if one wishes to copy and paste into or out-of tmux using mouse
> selections.

#### Other config file settings

Force a reload of the config file on `C-a r`:

```
unbind r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

Some other settings that I use:
```
setw -g xterm-keys on
```

Usage, at command line:

```shell
$ tmux new -s foglamp    # create a new session named foglamp
$ tmux ls                # list active sessions
$ tmux attach            # attach to first active session
$ tmux attach -t foglamp # attach to session named "foglamp".
```
> :notebook_with_decorative_cover: **NOTE**: `tnew` is an alias to create a
> session named using the current directory

## :unicorn: Vimization of everything

Also an included `Ctrl-R` reverse history search feature in editrc, very useful
in irb, postgres command line, and etc.

## :pizza: Vim - What's included?

 * [Navigation - NERDTree, EasyMotion, FZF and more](doc/vim/navegation.md)
 * [Code manipulation - rails support, comments, snippets, highlighting](doc/vim/coding.md)
 * [Utils - indents, paste buffer management, lots more](doc/vim/utils.md)
 * [General enhancements that don't add new commands](doc/vim/enhancements.md)

A list of some of the most useful commands that Dotfiles provides in vim are
included below. This is not a comprehensive list. To get deeper knowledge,
practice a few of these every day, and then start looking into the lists
of plugins above to learn more.

### Navigation

 * `,z` - go to previous buffer (:bp)
 * `,x` - go to next buffer (:bn)
 * `Cmd-j` and `Cmd-k` to move up and down roughly by functions (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `Ctrl-o` - Old cursor position - this is a standard mapping but very useful, so included here
 * `Ctrl-i` - opposite of Ctrl-O (again, this is standard)

### Search/Code Navigation

 * `,tg` - instantly Find definition of class (must have exuberant ctags installed)
 * `,T` - same as `,tg` but in a vertical split
 * `,gf` or `Ctrl-f` - same as vim normal gf (go to file), but in a vertical
split (works with file.rb:123 line numbers also)
 * `gF` - standard vim mapping, here for completeness (go to file at line number)
 * `,k` - Search the current word under the cursor and show results in quickfix window
 * `,K` - Grep the current word up to next exclamation point (useful for ruby foo! methods)
 * `,hl` - toggle search highlight on and off
 * `,gg` or `,ag` - Grep command line, type between quotes. Uses Ag Silver Searcher.
After searching with `,gg` you can navigate the results with `Ctrl-x` and `Ctrl-z` (or standard vim `:cn` and `:cp`)
 * `,gd` - Grep def (greps for 'def [function name]') when cursor is over the function name
 * `,gcf` - Grep Current File to find references to the current file
 * `//` - clear the search
 * `,,w` (alias `,<esc>`) or `,,b` (alias `,<shift-esc>`) - EasyMotion, a
vimperator style tool that highlights jump-points on the screen and lets you
type to get there.
 * `,mc` - mark this word for MultiCursor (like sublime). Use `Ctrl-n` (next),
`Ctrl-p` (prev), `Ctrl-x`(skip) to add more cursors, then do normal vim
   things like edit the word.
 * `gK` - Opens the documentation for the word under the cursor.
Spacebar - Sneak - type two characters to move there in a line.
Kind of like vim's `f` but more accurate.
 * `:Gsearch foo` - global search, then do your normal `%s/search/replace/g` and
follow up with `:Greplace` to replace across all files. 
When done use `:wall` to write all the files.

### File Navigation

 * `,fzf`  - Fzf-vim fuzzy file selector
 * `,fb` - Fzf-vim buffer selector - great for jumping to a file you already have open
 * `,fbt` - jump to method - Fzf tag search within current buffer
 * `Ctrl-\` - Show current file in NERDTree

### Better keystrokes for common editing commands

 * Ctrl-Space to autocomplete. Tab for snipmate snippets.
 * `,#` `,"` `,'` `,]` `,)` `,}` to surround a word in these common wrappers.
 the # does #{ruby interpolation}. works in visual mode. Normally these are
 done with something like `ysw#` `Cmd-'`, `Cmd-"`, `Cmd-]`, `Cmd-)`, etc to
 change content inside those surrounding marks. You don't have to be inside them (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `,.` to go to last edit location (same as `'.`) because the apostrophe is hard on the pinky
 * `,ci` to change inside any set of quotes/brackets/etc

### Tabs, Windows, Splits

 * Use `Cmd-1` thru `Cmd-9` to switch to a specific tab number (like iTerm) -
 and tabs have been set up to show numbers (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `Ctrl-h,l,j,k` - to move left, right, down, up between splits. This also
 works between vim and tmux splits thanks to `vim-tmux-navigator`.
 * `Q` - Intelligent Window Killer. Close window `wincmd c` if there are
 multiple windows to same buffer, or kill the buffer `bwipeout` if this is the
 last window into it.
 * `vv` - vertical split (`Ctrl-w,v`)
 * `ss` - horizontal split (`Ctrl-w,s`)
 * `,qo` - open quickfix window (this is where output from Grep goes)
 * `,qc` - close quickfix

### Utility

 * `Ctrl-p` after pasting - Use `p` to paste and `Ctrl-p` to cycle through
 previous pastes. Provided by YankRing.
 * `,yr` - view the yankring - a list of your previous copy commands. also you
 can paste and hit `ctrl-p` for cycling through previous copy commands
 * `crs`, `crc`, `cru` via abolish.vim, coerce to snake_case, camelCase, and
 UPPERCASE. There are more `:help abolish`
 * `:NR` - NarrowRgn - use this on a bit of selected text to create a new split
 with just that text. Do some work on it, then :wq it to get the results back.
 * `,cf` - Copy Filename of current file (full path) into system (not vi) paste buffer
 * `,cn` - Copy Filename of current file (name only, no path)
 * `,yw` - yank a word from anywhere within the word (so you don't have to go to
 the beginning of it)
 * `,ow` - overwrite a word with whatever is in your yank buffer - you can be
 anywhere on the word. saves having to visually select it
 * `,ocf` - open changed files. open all files with git changes in splits
 * `,w` - strip trailing whitespaces
 * `sj` - split a line such as a hash {:foo => {:bar => :baz}} into a multiline hash (j = down)
 * `sk` - unsplit a link (k = up)
 * `Cmd-Shift-A` - align things (type a character/expression to align by, works
 in visual mode or by itself) (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `:ColorToggle` - turn on #abc123 color highlighting (useful for css)
 * `:Gitv` - Git log browsers
 * `,hi` - show current Highlight group. if you don't like the color of
 something, use this, then use `hi! link [groupname] [anothergroupname]` in
 your vimrc.after to remap the color. You can see available colors using `:hi`
 * `,gt` - Go Tidy - tidy up your html code (works on a visual selection)
 * `:Wrap` - wrap long lines (e.g. when editing markdown files)
 * `Cmd-/` - toggle comments (usually gcc from tComment) (`Alt` in Linux)
 * `gcp` (comment a paragraph)

### Rails & Ruby

 * `,vv` and `,cc` to switch between view and controller - these are maps to
 :Rcontroller and :Rview. Explore the :R<Tab> family of commands for more fun
  from rails.vim!
 * `,rs` and `,rl` to run rspec or a spec line in iTerm (check iTerm window for results)
 * `,ss` and `,sl` for the same using `spring rspec` which makes your Rails
 specs faster by caching the Rails env (must have spring gem installed)
 * vim-ruby-refactoring - try `,rem`, `,rel` to extract methods or let statements
 * `:Bopen [gem name]` to navigate to a gem.
 * `,orb` - outer ruby block. takes you one level up from nested blocks (great for rspec)

### Vim Dev

 * `,vc` - (Vim Command) copies the command under your cursor and executes it in
 vim. Great for testing single line changes to vimrc.
 * `,vr` - (Vim Reload) source current file as a vim file

## :whale: Testing with Docker

We can use Docker to test some changes in a **Linux** Container.

Assuming your host system has `docker` and `docker-compose` properly installed, run:

```shell
$ docker-compose run dotfiles
```

This will build the container image if it never built it before (which may take
a while -- future times will be faster) and then run a `zsh` session inside
that container for you. There you can play around, test commands, aliases, etc.
